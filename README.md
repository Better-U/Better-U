# BetterU

BetterU is a web application designed for users who want to keep track of their health 

## Developer Documentation

### Tools Used:

* AngularJS
* ui-router
* Socket.IO
* Node
* Express
* MySQL
* KnexJS
* Mocha
* Protractor
* Travis CI

### Front-end

BetterU utilizes AngularJS and Ionic Components to render the front-end. We used the industry-standard ui-router for application routing and built-in Angular factories to manage state.

All API calls are made in the corresponding factory file associated for the type of data that it’s maintaining.

### Back-end

WingMe’s custom RESTFul API is built with Node.js and Express, and data management is handled by KnexJS and SQLite.
