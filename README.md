### Front-end

BetterU utilizes AngularJS to render the front-end. Built-in Angular factories were used to manage state. Additionally, ui-router was implemented to enable application routing. 

All API calls are made in the corresponding factory file associated for the type of data that it is maintaining.

Our chat feature utilizes the Socket.IO library and our data visualizations are created with Chartist.

### Back-end

BetterUâ€™s custom RESTFul API is built with Node.js and Express. Data management is handled by KnexJS and MySQL.
